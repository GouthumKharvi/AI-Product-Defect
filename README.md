# ðŸ§ª AI Defect Detection App

## Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered web application designed to automatically detect defective products using deep learning models. The app allows users to upload product images and returns a prediction indicating whether the product is **good** or **defective** based on image analysis. The solution includes model monitoring with performance logging, alerting for low-confidence predictions, and Grad-CAM visualization for explainability.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   Images of products were collected and labeled as either good or defective. The images were preprocessed (resized, normalized) to the input sizes required by each model.

2. **Model Training & Selection**  
   - MobileNetV2, Custom CNN, and EfficientNetB0 models were trained or fine-tuned for binary classification (defective vs. good).  
   - The best performing models were saved as `.h5` files.

3. **Building the Streamlit App**  
   - A user-friendly interface was developed using Streamlit.  
   - Users can upload images and select which model to use for prediction.  
   - Predictions are made in real-time, displaying labels and confidence scores.

4. **Prediction & Confidence Handling**  
   - Model outputs are interpreted as a probability score.  
   - Predictions with confidence below a configurable threshold trigger a warning and are logged for further review.

5. **Grad-CAM Visualization**  
   - Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) heatmaps provide explainability by highlighting image regions influential in the prediction.  
   - Users can toggle visualization to better understand model decisions.

6. **Feedback Mechanism**  
   - Users can provide feedback on prediction correctness, which is logged for future analysis and model improvement.

7. **Monitoring & Logging (Phase 5)**  
   - Extensive logging records prediction latency, confidence scores, uptime events, and misclassifications.  
   - Low-confidence predictions trigger email alerts for proactive monitoring.

## Monitoring & Logging (Phase 5)

- **Uptime Logging:** Records app start and health check events.  
- **Latency Logging:** Measures and logs time taken for each prediction.  
- **Confidence Logging:** Logs confidence scores for each prediction.  
- **Misclassification Logging:** Stores misclassified samples (based on user feedback).  
- **Email Alerts:** Sends automated emails when predictions fall below confidence threshold.

All logs are stored in a dedicated folder (`monitoring_logs`) within the project directory.

## Future Improvements

* Add automated unit and integration tests for prediction and logging functions
* Deploy the app using Docker and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
* Expand dataset to cover more defect types and edge cases
* Implement a more robust alerting system (SMS, Slack notifications)
* Use a database for logging feedback and misclassifications instead of plain text files
* Add user authentication for controlled access and feedback tracking
